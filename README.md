# Youtube-Clone
This project is a clone of the popular video-sharing platform YouTube. It replicates many of the core features and functionalities of YouTube, allowing users to watch, upload, and interact with videos in a familiar environment. The Search Functionality searches for videos using keywords or categories. The website is responsive and works well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. It is just a frontend youtube clone for now, no much functionality.
